# PVZ2 Session - October 28th 2020

I was able to update the game today with 2+ gigabytes of free space. The update wasn't a good one. It seems like good content is removed for crappier content with every major update. This update is no exception. I shouldn't expect more from EA. It would have been nice if they didn't buy PopCap.

In this update, a new mode was added, but over 100 levels were removed. The demonstration minigame and ultimate battle music wasn't even added back, so it was pointless. The update also saved over a gigabyte of space on my phone, I think it was slimmed down too much.

Near the end of the session, I tried to do a cloud backup of my account, but no matter how I typed my secondary email address, it wouldn't send. I was able to back up with Google play for now.
